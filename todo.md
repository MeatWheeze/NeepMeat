# Insane Ramblings

An Integrator is a biomechanical intelligence construct whose function is to ease the production of machines.

The Integrator exudes alien microfauna that convert all biotic material into Body Compound, the basis of all machines.

Ordinary wheat, spliced with members of the unseen biosphere. The rustling of its leaves whispers of the Divine.

GOD IS DEAD! And we used its flesh to fuel a second industrial revolution.

Whisper Wheat can be ground into Whispers From Beyond. These can be processed by an Integrator to get Data.

Dissolving Whisper Flour in water gives Cosmic Fluid.

Dissolving Whisper Flour in blood gives Work Fluid.

An assembly table is used to construct late-game machinery.

## Key Crafting Types

Mixing
- Mixer and Process Tank

Forging
- Whisper Forge

Crafting
- Vanilla Crafting Table and Assembly Table


## Ore Duplication
- [nyi] Grind up some raw ore in a crusher
- [nyi] Remove the raw ore and dissolve in in ELDRITCH ENZYMES using a [nyi] Mixer or a [pi] Process Tank
- [nyi] Insert the MEAT slurry into trommel to extract MORE ORES!
- [nyi] Insert MEAT into the trommel to extract DIVINE FLESH


## Late-Game Machinery

Biomass reprocessor
- Better version of the grinder

# Early-Game Progress Path

- Pipes and redstone pumps are obtainable from Vanilla resources

- [nyi] Find an Integrator Egg in a dungeon
- Offer a bucket of blood to the Intergrator Egg to hatch it
- Insert flesh into a Charnel Compactor to get Integration Charges

# XP System

Surrogate nervous system collects XP. Taking cuttings gives XP-rich nervous tissue. These can be ground up to make XP meat. This can be packed XP cans or diffused into the world, at a loss.
