All meat is an unknowing ritual sacrifice to the gods of nature. Through the sifting of flesh, we will find remnants of the Divine, and through them will be delivered enlightenment. At NEEP, we are pleased to announce a new range of superior, flesh-based industrial machines that will allow your company to augur the Divine with efficiency and excellence.

Welcome to the world of NeepMeat, a Minecraft mod concerning automation, logistics and cosmic horror (WIP). 


## Feature Overview

- Fluid pipes: An extensive fluid transfer system is provided, complete with tanks and valves. Fluids obey gravity, so fewer pumps are required.
- Item pipes: I miss RedPower 2.
- Block breakers and placers: 
- Advanced ore processing: Dissolve raw ores in Eldritch Enzymes, filter out impurities in a Trommel and produce ingots with the Casting Basin and Hydraulic Press.
- Building blocks: Plenty of rusty, dungy and... bloody? textures are provided. Perfect for decorating hospitals, abattoirs, cathedrals and more!
- Meat [zalgo pls]

## Getting Started

- Obtaining an Integrator:
Integrator Eggs can be found in dungeon loot. To hatch one, you must obtain blood by slaughtering a mob over a Drain with the Sacrificial Dagger. This blood can then be pumped into the egg using fluid pipes. A fully-grown Integrator has an internal buffer of 'Enlightenment' that is used by workstations that are connected by Data Cables. This buffer fills up slowly over time and can be boosted by inserting Whisper Wheat.

- Obtaining Body Compound
Body compound is a common crafting item in NeepMeat. To produce it, connect a Charnel Compactor to a fully-grown Integrator with Data Cables. The Charnel Compactor fuunctions much like a Composter, except it requires flesh. We hope that you have a burgeoning meat industrial complex.

- Energy Transfer
Machines require energy which is transferred through various fluids.

- Crops
NeepMeat provides two major crops. Gland Potatoes can be processed into Eldritch Enzymes in a mixer. Whisper Wheat can be ground into Whisper Flour which can be fed to an Integrator to increase its Enlightenment.

- Enlightening
This is a recipe type where items are transmuted to special forms. To enlighten an item, connect a Pedestal that containing the item to a mature Integrator via Data Cables. Converting an item takes quantity of Enlightenment from the Integrator.

- Meat Steel
Meat steel is required for mid-tier machinery. It is made by combining an Iron Ingot and a Raw Meat Brick in an alloy furnace. 

## Potential Future Features

- Automatic farming
- Multiblock tank
- In-game guide tablet
- Advanced item and fluid logistics
- Programmable automation controller
- More eldritchness


Since this is version 0.1, there will likely be many issues with varying levels of seriousness. I haven't encountered anything that has permanently damaged a world, but for the love of Azathoth, DO NOT USE THIS VERSION IN A WORLD YOU CARE ABOUT WITHOUT BACKING UP.
