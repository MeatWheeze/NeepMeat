NeepMeat is a Minecraft mod that adds various forms of darkly aesthetic automation.

## Features

- **Fluid pipes**: Complete with tanks, valves and pumps.
- **Item pipes**: Simple and pretty item transfer. Advanced routing is planned.
- **Numerous machines**: Block breaking and placing, auto-crafting, smelting, etc.
- **Advanced ore processing**: A rather involved process that involves eldritch enzymes and cosmic fat.
- **Building blocks**: Plenty of rusty, dingy and... bloody? textures are provided. Perfect for decorating hospitals, abattoirs, cathedrals and more!

Github shows many contributors who have not contributed to this obscure project. This is because I started with the Fabric ExampleMod and started committing to the repository without squashing the commits. I'm unsure how much of an issue this is, but it feels as though I'm claiming falsely that these people (some of them well-known in the Fabric ecosystem) have contributed to my mod.

For anyone who wants to look at my ~spaghetti~ codebase: Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate! If you're getting into Fabric modding and want examples, please regard everything I've done with extreme suspicion.
